      <p>
        Happy Birthday, my love.<br><br>
        You are one of the most beautiful blessings God has placed in my life.
        Your heart, your strength, your kindness, and even the little things you
        do without realizing — they mean more to me than words can fully express.
        <br><br>
        Loving you feels natural, peaceful, and right. You make life lighter,
        happier, and sometimes difficult just by being you.
        <br><br>
        Today, I celebrate <strong>you</strong> — the woman I admire, cherish,
        and choose every single day.
